# **Optimized Pricing Strategy Using Machine Learning**

## ðŸ“Œ **Project Overview**
This project focuses on optimizing apartment pricing by leveraging **Machine Learning models** to analyze **price elasticity and demand utilization**. The goal was to determine the optimal pricing strategy that maximizes revenue.

## ðŸš€ **Key Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handled **1,477 missing values** and **389 duplicate entries** to improve data quality.  
- **Feature Selection**: Conducted **graphical analysis** to determine relationships between descriptive features and price.  
- **Model Comparison**: Implemented and compared multiple models, including:  
  - Decision Trees  
  - Clustering  
  - Linear & Non-Linear Regression  
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)  
  - Neural Networks  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Achieved the best utilization with a **Neural Network model (MAE: 19.33)**.  
- **Revenue Optimization**: Determined that **clustering-based pricing** yielded the highest revenue.  

## ðŸ›  **Tech Stack & Tools**
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Machine Learning Techniques**: Clustering, Regression (Linear & Non-Linear), Neural Networks  
- **Data Processing**: Handling missing values, outlier detection, data visualization  

## ðŸ“Š **Results & Insights**
- Decision tree models were **limited by binning**, leading to suboptimal price estimates.  
- Clustering models struggled due to **imbalanced datasets**, impacting accuracy.  
- **Neural Networks provided the best utilization (MAE: 19.33)**, making them the most effective choice.  
- **Clustering-based pricing** was identified as the **optimal revenue-generating strategy**.  

## ðŸ“Œ **Future Enhancements**
- Collect additional data points to improve **price variation analysis**.  
- Experiment with **time-series forecasting** for dynamic pricing adjustments.  
- Implement **real-time price optimization** based on demand trends.
